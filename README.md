# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Layout is a component from ant design, not a self closing component, it basically lays everything down
colon means that coinId will be dynamic
Switch component is from react-router-dom, it allows us to have multiple routes

In ant design total span is 24 so span of 12 means it will cover half of screen 
Statistics is self closing component, and we can pass two different things
here we are passing title and value(realtime)
 We are using dynamic values using millify function

xs means extra small devices, sm means small devices and lg means large devices
also 24 means full width so on mobile devices the card will occupy full width 
on tabs there will be two cards and on large devices there will be 4 such cards 

Cryptocurrency Web Application:
Built a Cryptocurrency React application containing in-depth data about cryptocurrencies, markets, and popular crypto news.
Used React for frontend, Redux Toolkit to create Actions and Reducers, Hooks for state management.
Used DOM manipulation, making API calls & parsing JSON data to display page contents. 
Used Ant design to make the User Interface of the application.
Used Coinranking API to display the Real-time cryptocurrency price and market data.
Used Bing News Search API to search and display news about any cryptocurrency.
Used Chartjs to display the market trend of Cryptocurrency for different time duration.

Exposure- React, Ant Design, Rapid API, Redux Toolkit, Chartjs
